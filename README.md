# Tesla-Stock-Price-Analysis-and-comparison-with-S-P-500
Tesla's stock has increased dramatically in the last two years. Tesla's market capital was 117 billion dollars in 2020, and it has since grown to 800 billion dollars in 2022, in the course of its expansion, it has also passed the trillion-dollar mark. Tesla's stock is considered to be extremely volatile. I used machine learning model Linear Regression to study and understand the predictability of Tesla stock price utilizing Open, High, Low, Close, and Volumes as features of last 2 years data. Also compared it with one of the most reliable market index S&amp;P 500 by calculating the Beta value.
